Assignment Objectives
--
1.Create a R Markdown file
2.Loading and Preprocessing the Activity Data
3.Using R in the Markdown file provide responses for the following questions:
3a.What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
3b.What is the average daily activity pattern?
3c.Imputing missing values
3d.Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
Introduction
--
It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement using activity monitoring devices such as a Fitbit, Nike Fuelband, or Jawbone Up. These type of devices are part of the “quantified self” movement – a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But this data remains under-utilized because the raw data is hard to obtain and there are limited tools and statistical methods available for interpreting the data.
This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.
Data
--
The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web site:
Dataset: [Activity monitoring data](http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip) [52K]
The variables included in this dataset are:
steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA)
date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken
The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Set Global Echo = On
# Load data
dlurl <- 'http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip'
download.file(dlurl,destfile='repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip',mode='wb')
unzip('repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip')
# Read data
activitydata <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```
3a.What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
--
```{r}
steps_by_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activitydata, sum)
hist(steps_by_day$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Each Day"), col="green",xlab="Number of Steps")
rmean <- mean(steps_by_day$steps)
rmedian <- median(steps_by_day$steps)
print(rmean)
print(rmedian)
```
The mean is `rmean`  and the median is <code> rmedian </code>
3b.What is the average daily activity pattern?
--
* Calculate average steps for each interval for all days.
* Plot the Average Number Steps per Day by Interval.
* Find interval with most average steps.
```{r}
steps_by_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, activitydata, mean)
plot(steps_by_interval$interval,steps_by_interval$steps, type="l", xlab="Interval", ylab="Number of Steps",main="Average Number of Steps per Day by Interval")
```
